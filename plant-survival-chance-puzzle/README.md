***Plan Survival Puzzle***

There is a plant sepcies in a desert that has a specific living pattern. A recatangular field which is represented by a double dimensional matrix of MXN 
size contains plants in each cell of matrix.

Each plant will be surrounded by minimum 1 and maximum 8 neighbors. A particular plant could be either live(1) or dead(0).
The survival of a particular cell plant depends on a certain set of rules which decides its survival in next generation. Rules are as follows:

1. A live plant  will survive in next generation only if it has minimum S1 and maximum S2 live plants in its neighborhood.

2. A dead plant will survive in next generation only if it has minimum B1 and maximum B2 live plants in its neighborhood.

For example: A double dimension matrix with cells as 1 and 0 displayed as below. Where 1 is used for live plant and 0 is for dead plant.


0 0 0 1

1 0 0 1

0 0 0 1

For S1 >= 2 and S2 <= 3 and B1 >= 3 and B2 <= 3
